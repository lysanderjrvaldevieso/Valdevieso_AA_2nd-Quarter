		<p>Highlighters are a strategic investment in improving learning outcomes, not just a matter of personal taste when it comes to the back-to-school shopping list. Highlighters stand out as crucial tools for academic performance because of their capacity to concentrate attention, enable active reading, stimulate good note-taking, and support active study practices. The bright strokes of a highlighter become more than simply colorful marks on paper as children start a new school year; they become lights that lead the path to understanding, productivity, and structure. In the pursuit of knowledge and academic success, the modest highlighter—which is sometimes disregarded—proves to be an enlightening force.</p>
